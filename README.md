Saltwater Locations:
Salt Water composes most of the planets hydrosphere and is integral to all life on the planet. The Worlds seas are the habitat of over 230,000 know species, but so little of these seas are unexplored, some estimate that number to be over 2,000,000. Each species is unique: from microscopic algae to the largest know animals in existence. At Underwater Lifestyles we are interested in helping you to safely bring these species safely into your home or office. 

Huahine-Iti Islands:

Freshwater Locations:
Fresh water is any naturally occurring water except for seawater. All water is critical for the continual life of all organisms. Most Fresh water is accumulated precipitation forming vast streams, rivers, and Lakes. The amount of Fresh Water species falls short of what is contained in the worldâ€™s oceans, only clocking in at around 10,000. Many of them are small and may seem insignificant, but they pay a vital role in sustaining life on our planet. At Underwater Lifestyles we are 100% committed to safe removal of all species we offer as not to disturb any part if the environment.

Lake Erie:
Lake Erie is one of the five Great Lakes of the Midwest. It is known for its shallow, warm waters. It is fed by Detroit River and drains into the Niagara river, forming the Niagara Falls. These elements create a complex ecosystem with many species in constant interaction. Underwater Lifestyles calls Lake Erie our home and are dedicated to preserving it.
